# Facial Emotion Recognition Using CNN with Genetic Algorithm Optimization

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a facial emotion recognition system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with a unique approach of integrating genetic algorithm optimization. The goal is to create a robust model capable of accurately recognizing various emotions depicted in facial images provided by the client.

## Challenges

- **Limited Dataset**: The primary challenge was the scarcity of data provided by the client, consisting of approximately 6000 images. This limitation posed a significant obstacle to achieving satisfactory model accuracy using traditional methods.

## Approach

To address the data scarcity issue and enhance model performance, the following approach was adopted:

1. **Data Augmentation**: Implemented data augmentation techniques to artificially expand the dataset, thereby improving the model's ability to generalize from limited examples.
   
2. **K-fold Cross-Validation**: Employed K-fold cross-validation to evaluate the model's performance effectively and ensure its reliability.

3. **Genetic Algorithm Optimization**: Leveraged genetic algorithms to fine-tune the hyperparameters of the CNN architecture. By iteratively optimizing parameters such as learning rate, batch size, and network architecture, the model's performance was significantly enhanced.

## Key Achievements

- Developed a robust facial emotion recognition model using CNNs.
- Successfully employed genetic algorithm optimization to enhance model accuracy.
- Implemented data augmentation techniques to mitigate the effects of limited dataset size.
- Utilized K-fold cross-validation for comprehensive model evaluation.

## Usage

1. **Dataset**: Ensure the availability of the dataset provided by the client.
   
2. **Environment Setup**: Set up the required Python environment with necessary dependencies (e.g., TensorFlow, Keras).

3. **Training**: Train the facial emotion recognition model using the provided dataset and the implemented techniques.

4. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the trained model using K-fold cross-validation to assess its performance.

## Future Improvements

- Explore additional data augmentation techniques to further enhance model generalization.
- Investigate advanced CNN architectures or ensemble methods to improve accuracy.
- Optimize genetic algorithm parameters for better hyperparameter tuning efficiency.

## Conclusion

This project highlights the effectiveness of integrating advanced techniques such as genetic algorithm optimization with CNNs for facial emotion recognition. Despite the challenges posed by limited data, the adopted approach successfully resulted in the development of a robust model with practical applications in various domains.
